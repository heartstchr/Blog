Material design is a Design language developed by google to communicate with user and devices.It contains Light and Shadow,Color, Quantum Paper,Transformation which is similar to real world.This will help the user to sync with real world stuff.Light and shadow of material comes in every 3D space in our real world (any material).Color of material is paint on canvas.A quantum paper is amount of paper involved in an interaction with user.Transformation is how material can be transformed to one place to another.
For mobile device with Android Platform https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html this link will give you detail explanation to implement into app.Simillary, For ios platform https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit .

For Web components, I wolud recommend Polymer as It gives you flexiblity to create your own element or use element created by other to add to the web.Element is bundel of CSS,HTML,Javascript which is bulding block of an web page that can be reused.With this element developer reduce there time to bulid the web page from scratch.you can use one or more element to combine and sothing good out of it.similary, 'materlize.css' will reduce the complexity to give style layout and color from scratch.

There are many other Frameworks where you can integrate it with.Integration and support for other frameworks like Angular, Node,laravel.This link will give you the idea https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/ and http://material-ui.com/#/ 

Material Design Lite is where you will get same material felling with reduce in time to load and wait for resultto display in any device which result to good user experience. click here to know more http://www.getmdl.io/.

I would like to conclude by saying it is easy to implement and easy to use which help both user and developer in design for logical wolrd.
